# NEURAL NETWORKS - DEEP LEARNING: UNIVERSITY PROJECTS

The current repository contains various projects built as part of the university course **"Neural Networks - Deep Learning"**

## Intermediate project
The intermediate project is about training and testing the following classifiyng algorithms:
- K Nearest Neighbours (K = 1 & K = 3) Classifier
- Nearest Centroid Classifier
based on **Premier League match data from the 2020-2021 season until the 2024-2025 season** and trying to predict match outcomes (home win, draw, away win).
The models are compared on their accuracy, precision and recall.

## 1st project
The first project is about training and testing an **MLP FeedForward Neural Network** on the same data mentioned above.
Before training and testing it, we test **different hyperparameter values** in order to find the best ones and train the model using them. We are going to test different values of:
- Training epochs
- Hidden neurons
- Hidden layers
- Learning rate
Eventually, we are going to compare the network's accuracy with the accuracy achieved by K-NN and NC.
